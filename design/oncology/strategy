SHR ONCOLOGY STRATEGY

STRATEGY SUMMARY
==========

The primary goal until February 2018, is to refine and demonstrate the collection and curation of real world oncology based data via the clinical use of Flux Notes. A design and plan for executing on the patient + clinician collaborative service will be ready by the February MITRE executive brief (28.Feb.18). The next phase will be to design and demonstrate a patient - clinician collaboration service to drive greater accuracy of oncology based data through use of patient touchpoints.

## DESIGN GOALS (STRATEGY)
**Deliver Flux Notes for ASCO/DFCI/iCare** 
  Flux Notes Lite
  Flux Notes Full
  Data curation visualizations for at least 3 patients based on Flux Notes full designs

**Collaborative care service**
  Core oncology record for patients, mobile-based POS design with VUI interaction (such as Adverse Events, family history, PROs)
  Core oncology record interaction and system
  Design of a patient encounter data receipt

**Jump-start the open source SHR design community**
  Document the design approach/tenants/structure
  Seed and engage with oncology care clinician user group 
  Seed and engage with primary care clinician user group 
  Seed and engage with patient user group
  Incorporate user group + core view designs into SHR.org


## DESIGN GOALS (TACTICAL + DELIVERABLES)
**Deliver Flux Notes for ASCO/DFCI/iCare** 
  Flux Notes Lite
  Flux Notes Full
    Collect feedback from the clinical user group
    Refine the Flux Notes Full static design and concepts
    Refine the Flux Notes Full prototype
  Data curation visualizations for at least 3 patients based on Flux Notes full designs

**Collaborative care service**
  Core oncology record for patients
    Explore different avenues for ensuring collection and curation of high quality data (remote mobile patient entered, disc format, pdf/paper. Future views like wearable sensors, genomic data, etc)
    Identify what patient data is most needed in clinical trials but hard to get
    Identify list of patient entered data: symptoms, family history, adverse events, etc
    Design of the calculated insights based on inputted data
    Design the patient facing data collection and curation service (mobile, VUI)
  Core oncology record interaction and system
    Service showing its relationship to MITRE open services
    Workflow + storyboards for how data is collected and curated for higher quality
  Design of a patient encounter data receipt
    Workflow + storyboards for how patients receive insights from entered data

**Jump-start the open source SHR design community**
  Document the design approach/tenants/structure
  Seed and engage with oncology care clinician user group 
  Seed and engage with primary care clinician user group 
  Seed and engage with patient user group
  Incorporate user group + core view designs into SHR.org


PROJECT KEY DATES
Mid dec 2017 - sep 2018: monthly clinical user group is in session
Jan 2018, estimate for getting patients into data curation study via DFCI
Feb 28: presentation of the last 5 months of work within SHR oncology
March 30: viz of data curation patients due
March 30: flux notes full release 1 at pilot site


TERMS
Data map: A single list of truth for the dev + design team in terms of all the data elements + priority of those data elements that would populate a certain view of Flux Notes.
Flux Notes workflow diagram: A diagram to show the interactions between the user needs/research + SHR data elements. Showing the steps in the clinical cognitive workflow and mapping the data elements on top, along with where Flux Notes is currently, and where it’s going in the future. 
MITRE open health services map: A diagram showing all the open health services that MITRE is currently working on, or will develop in the future, and how they are connected to each other. For use in dissemination + internal strategy/discussion.
